  caveats <<~EOS
    Stege replaces the system menu bar, so hide the system one:
      System Settings > Control Center > Automatically hide and show the menu bar > Always

    It needs Accessibility permission to read the frontmost app's menus and to
    drive them. macOS will prompt on first launch.

    The Spaces widget needs AeroSpace or yabai.
